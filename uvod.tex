Everyone has heard the term database. Databases are everywhere and data is being recorded all the time. We use databases in our smartphones when we're searching through our contact list. There are much bigger databases which contain employees records, patients, election votes or videos. We're using databases to store the most sensitive information about ourselves, like medical records or private business data. 

The world is now more connected than ever, a lot of people want to access the same data at once. To meet this need, databases have become distributed. Employees in the sales department are sharing the same database with people from management or even from people from a different company which can be based abroad.

Suddenly you have to start asking questions. Whom do I trust to share my data? How can I ensure that someone else accessing my database is who they claim they're online? How do I know that my medical records were not changed? Why should I trust my government in an online election? 

One exciting new way share databases and achieve trust in the untrustworthy environment is through blockchain technology as a new form of a shared database with no central authority.
